The application has two activities;

1) Main activity: Contains a "login screen" like form, which requests the user to input the IP address and port that the FlightGear application listens on.
2) Joystick activity: After a successul connection, the application moves to another activity which contains a touch moveable joystick and two sliders. The joystick controls the Aileron and Elevator, and the sliders control the Radder and Throttle.
