# FG_Joystick

The application has two activities;

1) **Main activity**: Contains a *login screen* like form, which requests the user to input the IP address and port that the FlightGear application listens on.
2) **Joystick activity**: After a successul connection, the application moves to another activity which contains a touch moveable joystick and two sliders. The joystick controls the *Aileron* and *Elevator*, and the sliders control the *Rudder* and *Throttle*.

If the connection was not successfull, the application will simply ask the user to reinput the IP address and port.
